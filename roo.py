A context manager usually takes care of setting up some resource,
e.g. opening a connection. and automatically handles the clean up when we are done with it.
Probably, the most common use case is opening a file.
Is open a context manager in Python?
You are not using the open function as a context manager.
It is the result of the open(...) call expression that is the context manager.
open() returns a file object, and it is that object that has __enter__ and __exit__ methods; see the io.03-May-2017
